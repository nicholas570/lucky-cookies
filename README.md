# Lucky Cookies Website

### Why?

Because I love cookies.

### How?

I thought this website as a template. All the data and images (keep the same file name!) can be modified in public/data.json file.

### What I used:

- React.js
- React router dom
- Hooks API
- Redux
- PropTypes
- Bootstrap 4
- Sass / Node-Sass
- Eslint / Prettier and Husky
- AirBnb style guide
- Netlify

### Todo:

- Create a layout and layouted routes
- Fix PropTypes
